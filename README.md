# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets focused on **data collection, data cleaning, and data visualization** using Python. The projects demonstrate an end-to-end data analysis workflow starting from raw data to cleaned and analyzed datasets.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this work is to understand real-world data, improve its quality through preprocessing, and extract insights using exploratory analysis and visualizations.

---

## Notebooks Included

### 1. Data Collection

**`Data_Collection.ipynb`**

* Collected raw real estate data and structured it into a usable tabular format.
* Performed initial inspection of the dataset to understand schema, data types, and basic distributions.

### 2. Data Cleaning

**`Data_Cleaning.ipynb`**

* Cleaned and preprocessed raw data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats.
* Prepared a refined dataset suitable for analysis and further processing.

### 3. Data Visualization

**`Data_Visualization.ipynb`**

* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the data.
* Created visualizations to analyze relationships such as pricing trends and feature distributions.

## Datasets Included

* **`real_estate_data.csv`** – Raw collected dataset
* **`Cleaned_RealEstate_Data.csv`** – Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
* **`Cleaned_RealEstate_Data1.csv`** – Alternative cleaned version for comparison
* **`Final_realestate_data.csv`** – Final dataset used for analysis
* **`lol.csv`**, **`new.csv`** – Intermediate or experimental datasets
